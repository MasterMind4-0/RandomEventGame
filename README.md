# Random Event Game
This game is a simple little thing that uses a `randomeventgenerator` function to randomly select paths, making a game that changes every time!

# Difference between [Alpha](https://github.com/MasterMind4-0/RandomEventGame/tree/alpha) and Main branch
The main difference between these two branches currently is that the [Alpha](https://github.com/MasterMind4-0/RandomEventGame/tree/alpha) is a version that has a completely different game system. It should be mentioned that the [Alpha](https://github.com/MasterMind4-0/RandomEventGame/tree/alpha) is also ***the only working version***.
The main branch version doesn't work, and is completely unfinished. The sole reason it is still the main version is because I am working the Alpha to have the features the main branch has, and only then will it replace it.
