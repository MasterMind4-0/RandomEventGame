# Random Event Game
This game is a simple little thing that uses a `randomeventgenerator` function to randomly select paths, making a game that changes every time!

# Difference between Alpha and [Main](https://github.com/MasterMind4-0/RandomEventGame) branch
The main difference between these two branches currently is that the [Main branch](https://github.com/MasterMind4-0/RandomEventGame) is a version that has a save system and, really, a completely different game system in general. However, the [Main branch](https://github.com/MasterMind4-0/RandomEventGame) is also ***completely unfinished and barely works***.
The only reason it is the [Main branch](https://github.com/MasterMind4-0/RandomEventGame) is that it was the original idea, and I still want that to be the game; it's just that I decided to rework it to get close to the features of the [Main branch](https://github.com/MasterMind4-0/RandomEventGame).
