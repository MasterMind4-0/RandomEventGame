# Random Event Game
This game is a simple little thing that uses a `randomeventpicker` function to randomly select paths, making a game that changes every time!

## Features
This game has many features, and of course, there are more to come.

### Changing gameplay
Because of the `randomeventpicker` function that picks from a list of differenct events randomly, you can be assured that each time you play will be different.

### Combat System
While, I'll admit, the combat system isn't the best, with limited features and player feedback options; it is versatile.
